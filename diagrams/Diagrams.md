# Software Engineering Tools: Diagram Creation

In this repository, we aim to gather all the tools that are useful for software engineering, with a special focus on diagram creation tools. Below are the tools that have been used and found useful. Each tool is described, and a space is provided for an example diagram, which will be added later.

## [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/)

PlantUML is a highly versatile tool that facilitates the rapid and straightforward creation of a wide array of diagrams. Utilizing a simple and intuitive language, users can effortlessly draft various types of diagrams. For a detailed exploration of the language's capabilities and syntax, please refer to the [PlantUML Language Reference Guide](https://plantuml.com/guide). If you are new to PlantUML, we recommend starting with our [quick start page](https://plantuml.com/starting) to get up and running quickly. Should you have any questions, our [F.A.Q. page](https://plantuml.com/faq) is a valuable resource. Additionally, PlantUML can be seamlessly integrated with a variety of other tools to enhance your workflow.
